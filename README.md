Alphabet Soup Funding Classifier
Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the success of funding applications submitted to Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation. The model will act as a binary classifier, determining whether an applicant is likely to successfully use the funds they receive from Alphabet Soup.

Given a dataset of over 34,000 organizations that have previously received funding, the project will leverage machine learning techniques and neural networks to create the classifier. The foundation aims to use this tool to select applicants with the highest chance of success in their ventures.

Dataset
The provided dataset contains information on organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup in the past. The dataset includes the following columns:

EIN: Employer Identification Number (Unique ID for each organization)

NAME: Name of the organization

APPLICATION_TYPE: Type of application submitted by the organization

AFFILIATION: Sector or industry the organization is affiliated with

CLASSIFICATION: Classification of the organization (e.g., government, nonprofit)

USE_CASE: The intended use of the funding

ORGANIZATION: The type of organization (e.g., educational, research)

STATUS: Whether the organization is currently active

INCOME_AMT: Income classification of the organization

SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS: Whether the organization has special considerations for the application

ASK_AMT: The amount of funding requested

IS_SUCCESSFUL: Target variable that indicates whether the funding was used successfully (1 for success, 0 for failure)

Project Structure
This project follows a series of steps, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. The goal is to build an accurate model that can predict the success of funding applications based on the provided features.

Data Preprocessing:

Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Remove identification columns (EIN, NAME) that do not contribute to the prediction.

Model Creation:

A neural network model will be developed using Keras/TensorFlow.

The model will include an input layer, multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation, and an output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.

Model Training:

Train the model on a training dataset and validate it using a separate test set.

Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, neurons per layer, epochs) to improve model performance.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
